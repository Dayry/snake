    # add lose condition if snake touches itself
    #
    # clean up snake creation in Snake init() call a method on win that creates the snake
    # remove some unused variables in snake/segment i.e. index, tail
    # refactor the move_head in segment WET
    # Clean up class properties, some have _ but are accessed outside class vv
    # Checking the fruit x y % 20 == 0 is very inefficent, fix the randomint call
    #   so it only generates %20 == 0 results
    #   might be because of this that fruit still spawns on snake body
    # as above fruit can spawn in snake body
